grangular
=========

Gulp + RequireJS + Angular

## About
Grangular is a proposed setup for building Angular 1X apps.

With the announcement of Angular 2, and the commitment from the Angular team to support AMD, the concerns of this setup are completely mitigated.

However, in the meantime, we still need a good way to bridge the awesome tidiness that RequireJS can give us for managing JS files, and the sheer unwieldy nature of AMD with Angular 1.
